# uber-react-native

**I made a simple Uber clone in React Native with TailwindCSS!**

To autocomplete the location search bars, I used the Google Places API.  I also utilized the Google Directions API and Google Distance Matrix API to get the directions and distance between the origin and the destination. With this data, I was able to calculate a realistic trip cost regardless of the trip.

I'm afraid that's it folks! Onto the next one! ðŸ˜Ž

Special thanks to Sonny Sangha for sharing this fun and educational project with me! You are an excellent instructor!

_Note: I have no affiliation with Uber (I'd love to tho ðŸ˜‰), nor do I own the rights to any of the material shown in this demo. Im just a bored college student on summer break who wanted to learn react native... ðŸ˜…_
