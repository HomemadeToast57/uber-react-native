# uber-react-native

I made a little Uber clone in React Native with TailwindCSS.

I used the Google Places API to autocomplete the search bar as well as the Google Directions API to get the directions between the origin and the destination.

Special thanks to Sonny Sangha for sharing this fun and educational project with me! You are an excellent instructor!
